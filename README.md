# Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room, our client, sought a software application design for their gaming platform inspired by Win, Lose or Draw, aiming to expand it onto multiple platforms using different software patterns in a distributed environment. The software design document detailed the requirements, design constraints, rationale, and evaluation of various platforms, including Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS. Each platform's hosting capabilities, licensing costs, development considerations, and development tools were evaluated to provide comprehensive insights into the optimal platform selection for Draw It or Lose It's expansion.

Throughout the development of this documentation, particular attention was given to articulating the rationale behind platform selection, design patterns, and integration of essential entities. The document effectively highlighted the strategic advantages of a cross-platform development approach, proper design patterns implementation, and focus on performance and usability. By prioritizing these aspects, the design document laid a strong foundation for the subsequent development phases, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and user satisfaction.

In hindsight, one aspect of the documentation that could benefit from revision is the elaboration on security measures. While the document touched upon security considerations, further detailing the specific mechanisms, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, would enhance the comprehensiveness of the design. Additionally, providing concrete examples and references to industry best practices in security would bolster the credibility and effectiveness of the proposed security measures. Overall, refining the security section would strengthen the design document's alignment with industry standards and client expectations.
